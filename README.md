# Dotfile repository

## Introduction
This is a backup of my dotfiles. Changes to this repository are made programmatically using the following scripts:
+ `backup.sh`: scans this repo, given the existing files, pulls from my `$HOME` and copies them here
+ `sync.sh`: updates your `$HOME` to match the files in this directory

## Upcoming
+ Sync Kitty configs and git submodule for base16 shell.
